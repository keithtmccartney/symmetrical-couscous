## Notes

Consider upgrading the pip version via the (C:\Python39) `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip` command.

Install the referenced libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This example makes use of a YouTube downloader that transcribes the audio files into text and will require [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to perform these audio tasks; you can install FFmpeg quite easily with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install): `choco install ffmpeg`.
